“The complexity of a woman doesn't have a specific definition. As women we are daughters, mothers, wives, providers, business women, entrepreneurs, leaders in our communities and over all game changers. As women we are often overwhelmed with life's daily responsibilities and challenges. Through the inner-strength that is a part of our genetic make-up, we find a way push through and care for others and the world around us. This so often leads to a lack of self-care and eventually in silence, an overwhelming number of women suffer from depression, bipolar disorder and other mental health issues.

Mental health issues with depression and anxiety being the most prevalent are plaguing the African American and Hispanic communities. 1 in 5 suffer from depression or anxiety with 1 in 4 are between the ages of 16-24. There is an urgency as our communities need healing.

It starts with having the conversations that are so often silenced. Totality of a Woman provides a “safe place” for women to open up and seek the assistance, support and resources needed in order for the healing to begin. The message of Totality of a Woman is SELF CARE is a LIFESTYLE. Our mission is to cultivate villages of healthy female leaders globally, via live activations including the launch of The Totality of a Woman Conference, tour, programs and more.”

Kym B has held yoga workshops and shown some members of Totality of a Woman the beneficial effects and properties of CBD during her yoga class. There was a Q&A and members were able to look at some of the CBD products Kym B’s Tribe Tokes offers. This event gave members an opportunity many wouldn’t have had otherwise, to learn about CBD and have their questions answered by someone knowledgeable on the topic.

CBD or **Cannabidiol, is a compound found in cannabis or hemp that does not contain the psychoactive properties that THC cannabis does. CBD has significant medicinal benefits and no psychoactive “high”. Cannabidiol is greatly beneficial for treating inflammation, anxiety, psychosis, seizures and many other conditions without the psychoactive properties of cannabis.**

Kym B has used her power and influence in her local community to spread knowledge and advocacy for programs such as this, which help improve the lives of those that live in marginalized areas. Programs such as the ones offered by Totality of a Woman, help empower women to take charge of their situation and move forward to better themselves. We live in a society that expects the world of women, yet offers little empowerment or opportunity for equal advancement or access to services and tools needed to not only succeed, but to thrive in today’s high paced, high stress world.
