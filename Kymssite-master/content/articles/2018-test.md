Hippies at heart We are “modern day hippies “. Our mission is to provide coffees and edibles that will enhance the life experience of health-conscious consumers through the use of legal, non-mind-altering infusions. We value the importance of giving back to the community, creating new jobs within Flower Power and our affiliations/partners, supporting worthy non-profits, and fundraising to benefit the community. We believe in the value of friendship, education and working with companies who have great products and/or with whom we can collaboratively develop innovative products.
