Women Grow connects, educates, and empowers diverse leaders in all segments of the cannabis industry. Together, we’ll start over 1,000 women-owned businesses in the marijuana industry. Founded in 2014, Women Grow is now the largest national network of cannabis professionals with [Monthly Events](http://womengrow.com/events/) for women & men across the US & Canada. Our popular [Speakers Bureau](http://womengrow.com/speaker-bureau/) ensures diversity at industry events and in media coverage. And no matter where you’re located, you can access our [Video Education](http://womengrow.com/video-education/) series. We model corporate responsibility by fulfilling a social mission in a for-profit structure. But supporting women goes far beyond altruism! Women make 80% of healthcare decisions and even consume more alcohol by volume than men. Female consumers will dominate cannabis purchasing in the same way they already control 85% of consumer spending. The inclusive teams creating cannabis products & services that women love will rise to the top as the end of cannabis prohibition occurs on a national scale.
