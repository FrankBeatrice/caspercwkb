# [CannaGather](https://cannagather.com/march2019/kymb)

CannaGather is the largest cannabis industry community in New York, and I am thrilled to have been part of its journey. Starting as a modest meetup in Manhattan, CannaGather has grown over the years to packing venues to the brim. Throughout its existence, CannaGather has committed to bringing a diverse array of speakers to each monthly event. Speakers include activists, investors, entrepreneurs and many others.

Today, CannaGather is expanding to locations including New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, California and more. Just like New York, these locations offer enthusiasts, entrepreneurs and everyone else the opportunity to network, learn and connect with the cannabis community.

As CannaGather’s plug for news and information, I am proud to present my segment, #CannabisWithKymB, and what you can expect at CannaGather.

## #TheRundown

Each CannaGather New York kicks off at 7 pm with a networking session, food and drinks from master mixologist Thomas LaRossa. Here, guests can tour around the tables and check out a ton of great products and services from lawyers to CBD companies, including my company [Tribe Tokes](https://tribetokes.com). Additional sponsors include BDS Analytics, Arcview and plenty of others on a one-off or a regular basis.

Around 20 minutes to 8 pm, we kick things off with news from yours truly, other updates and announcements from our sponsors. At 8 pm, our keynote speaker(s) take the stage with host Josh Weinstein to present their information and field questions from the audience. Then, we head to our nearby bar, Adoro Lei, for more networking opportunities.

## #DopeGuests

As I mentioned, CannaGather events always have a slew of speakers to satisfy everyone's canna interests. They include founders of cannabis products, like Paul Chu, a leader for companies including Weekend Unlimited, Hey Mary, Canna Candys and several others.

Government officials often drop in as well. They include Richard Carleton, CEO of the Canadian Securities Exchange. On the flip side, we've hosted prominent names in the media as well, like multi-award winning journalist John Stossel.

CannaGather also stays connected to the cannabis community by speaking with key activists in the space. They include Joy Beckerman, a founder and principal of Hemp Ace International, Director at NORML and one of my inspirations in the industry.

And be sure to let us know if you have any guests you think we should have! We’re stoked to hear about your thoughts and opinions on guests and the evening altogether.

## #GetInvolved

If you’ve been to a CannaGather NY event before, you’ll know how much I push for people to get involved. If you don’t show up, you can’t get involved. This was the case with me a few years ago when I was starting out, and continues to be the case for plenty of others.

With the industry set to boom more and more in the coming years, scores of others are ready to get into the cannabis industry. If you want to learn more, make the modest investment and come to CannaGather. If you can’t make it to New York, check out an event near you sometime soon.

Drop the CannaGather team or me a line if you have any questions. We’re happy to help. See you at an event soon!
