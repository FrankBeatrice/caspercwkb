“_Jane West, the badass canna-mom and entrepreneur,_

_answers my call while smoking a joint and drinking CBD coffee on her porch. West is a true OG cannabis activist who was hosting infused dinner parties well before they were being written about in_ Vogue_. In 2014, she founded_ [_Women Grow_](https://womengrow.com/)_, the largest professional networking organization for women in the cannabis business, and more recently, she launched her lifestyle brand, Jane West, which features glassware, accessories, and a new CBD collection. She made history again this year as one of the first CEOs in the cannabis space to raise equity crowdfunding capital_ [_through the Republic platform_](https://republic.co/jane-west) _(with 80% held by women and people of color). And even though West has been in the business for a while, it’s clear she’s just getting started. Here, we talk cannabis, gender parity, market innovation, and more.”
