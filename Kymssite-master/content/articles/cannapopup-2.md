### **Cannabis Event Review**: CannaPopUp the perfect event for the canna-curious

February 1, 2019

Montclair, New Jersey

There are definitely many cannabis themed events popping up, and on a daily basis. You have the "underground" scene and then there is the "above ground" legal canna-business scene. Both movements doing their own part in the ever evolving cannabis movement. Events that promote legal cannabis companies and products while opening the door to enlightenment through networking. The latter is my favorite. For someone as introverted as myself, I have found the cannaspace to be very warm and receptive to me. I feel very at home at these types of events once the initial shock wears off.

Recently I have been trying to attend more of these events, and I have to say no one puts on an event like Robert and Holli. They are the ultimate canna-power couple behind [**cannapopup**](https://cannapopup.com/ "https://cannapopup.com/")! They take the time and passion to carefully curate the vendors they bring together for each event. Each vendor is there to share their passion and knowledge with attendees. The products are always of the highest quality and usually all are local to the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania area, so you can feel good about supporting these canna-businesses with your purchases. This event didn’t feel like a giant sales pitch. Vendors genuinely seemed to care about the attendees and their needs pertaining to CBD and cannabis.

This event was very different from any other event that I have been to. The event was very open and free flowing. It was multiple rooms, which kept the space from being overly crowded, almost to spite the large crowd! At the front of the building there was really nice bright white walls that made the space seem welcoming, thought it wasn’t ideal for taking photos. The front space was split into three different areas that were the traffic could move around freely. In one space there were CBD edibles available, the next was a foyer where you were greeted at the door and could hang your coat and the next space there were various vendors and open seating where you could watch live performers. This particular event they had a lovely woman singing and playing guitar and there was also an acro-yoga demonstration performed by the lovely Sanna CBD Yoga power couple, Salam and Estefania! The music was captivating and just so lovely. Several times I found myself completely lost in it. I have had the pleasure of watching Salam an Estefania in the past and they never fail to exceed my expectations. They are just so skilled, educated and passionate. Every meeting with them is a delight. The back room was one open area. The lighting was a little dimmer. You couldn’t really tell what was going on up front. This space had more vendors which had products that ranged from CBD infused edibles, to CBD lip balm and bath bombs and even smokable CBD hemp flower.

The vibe of this event was so much more laid back than some of the ones I have been to in the recent past. Out of all of the events I have attended, this one is probably the best by far. I think I learned more by talking to the vendors face to face than I did in a more lecture like setting. Robert and Holli did speak briefly, but the event wasn’t set up to be a conference, but more like a free flowing, learn at your own pace and explore environment. You were able to touch, smell and in most cases taste products. There was an array of vendors offering vastly different products. There seemed to be something for everyone, no matter what you were looking for or willing to spend, and even if you didn’t buy anything, you didn’t leave empty handed! The information you gained while there is worth the admission alone!

These events are so vital to our community as legalization moves on, and people begin to understand the many benefits that cannabis has to offer beyond the obvious. Personally, cannabis has been monumental in giving me any quality of life while I deal with various chronic illnesses. Using cannabis, both CBD and THC has helped me to drastically cut back on my medications and cannabis allows me to live the most functional life I can. When people go to these events, they learn to use cannabis in their everyday life, in ways that help them live healthier and more active lifestyles. When people can see, smell and touch or even taste something, they are more receptive to what it can do for them. They are less apprehensive to try something new when it is in their hand and someone is speaking to them in a way and tone, they understand that doesn’t sound too clinical or salesy. In other words, there is no pressure to buy!

What struck me the most positively about the whole event was how welcoming it was. There were people of all age groups, social and economic standings, levels of health and professions. It was a literal melting pot of diversity, all brought together for one single purpose, and that was cannabis. The energy was high and there were smiles and laughter everywhere you looked. I feel like CannaPopUp is very, very young and that these events will continue to grow and build an almost cult like following, as it should. Robert and Holli are so passionate and the whole family plays a role in some form in the event, from their daughter running a table and taking photos, to their son taking video of the event for social media use. Seeing a whole family work together with a common mission was inspiring. Obviously, Robert and Holli are doing something right! Their open and honest relationships with their children have set the stage for them to be active in the community as well, putting their own skill sets to good use in furthering the advancement and understanding of cannabis to the community, and their follower around the world, via social media.

If you haven’t been to a CannaPopUp, I highly suggest you attend the next one. If you are reading this from outside New Jersey, fear not! They are working on live streaming these events in the near future. The next New Jersey CannaPopUp is going to be in West Orange, March 28, 2019.
